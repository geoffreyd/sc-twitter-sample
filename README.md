This is the example app that I used in my SproutCore talk at BrisJS on Aug 2

Please feel free to let me know if you make any updates.

If you want to use the new Ace theme run this from the root of this repo:

    > mkdir frameworks
    > cd frameworks
    > git clone git://github.com/sproutit/sproutcore.git sproutcore
    > git checkout -b quilmes origin/quilmes
    
If you want to step through the progress as made, checkout branches in this order:

1) dataSourceWorking
2) partialViews
3) workingViews
4) master
